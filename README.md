# Virtual Coin Toss Simulator
A Python program designed to simulate coin tosses, providing a fun and interactive way to explore basic programming concepts such as randomization, loops, and counters.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a simple yet engaging tool for users to simulate coin tosses. It allows users to specify the number of flips and displays the results, including the total number of "Heads" and "Tails" along with their respective percentages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for this project.
- **tkinter**: A Python library for creating simple graphical user interfaces.
- **random**: A built-in Python module for generating random numbers.

## Project Setup
### Hardware Requirements
- Any computer capable of running Python 3.x.

### Software Requirements
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- **tkinter**: This library is included with most Python installations. If not, you can install it using your package manager.

### Installation Steps
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the program using Python: `python virtual_coin_toss.py`

## How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the number of coin flips you want to simulate in the input field.
3. Click the "Flip Coin" button to simulate the coin tosses.
4. View the results, including the total number of "Heads" and "Tails" and their percentages.
5. Click "Repeat Session" to reset the counts and start a new session.
